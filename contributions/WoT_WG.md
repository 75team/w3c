### 2. [#233 | Same description of `identity` field in CertSecurityScheme/PublicSecurityScheme/PSKSecurityScheme](https://github.com/w3c/wot-thing-description/issues/233)

**内容：**

The descriptions of `identity` field in 5.4.4 CertSecurityScheme/5.4.8 PublicSecurityScheme, which is `'Pre-shared key identity.'`, are same with that in PSKSecurityScheme.

1. The description in CertSecurityScheme perhaps should be `'Certificate-base asymmetric key.'`
2. The description in PublicSecurityScheme perhaps should be `'Raw public key asymmetric key.'`

### 3. [#234 | Inconsistent `rel` description in 5.2.6 Form and 5.2.7 Link](https://github.com/w3c/wot-thing-description/issues/235)

**内容：**

As I understand it, the description of rel in 5.2.6 Form and 5.2.7 Link should be the same content. But now they are inconsistent. Is it a bug or is it intentional?
